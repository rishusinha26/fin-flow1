## 💡 How It Works

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
```
User → Frontend → financeService.ts → Backend API → In-Memory Storage
                                                    ↓
                                              Process & Calculate
                                                    ↓
                                              Return JSON Response
```

### Data Flow Example
```typescript
// Frontend Component
import { financeService } from './services/financeService';

// Add income
await financeService.addIncome({
  source: 'Salary',
  amount: 50000,
  isRecurring: true
});

// Get summary
const summary = await financeService.getFinancialSummary();
console.log(summary.savingsRate); // "30.00"
```
