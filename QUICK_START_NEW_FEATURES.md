## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Persistence
- Data is stored **in-memory** on backend
- Data is **lost when backend restarts**
- This is intentional for development
- Add database for production

### Backend Required
- Backend must be running for features to work
- If backend is down, components show empty state
- No errors, just graceful fallback

### Existing Features
- ✅ Chatbot still works
- ✅ All existing pages intact
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Everything else unchanged

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend not connecting?
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:5001/

# Should return API info
```

### Data not showing?
1. Check backend is running
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for network errors
4. Verify backend URL in `.env`

### Components not loading?
1. Check for TypeScript errors
2. Verify imports are correct
3. Restart frontend dev server
