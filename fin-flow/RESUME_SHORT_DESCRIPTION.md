## üé§ Elevator Pitch (For Interviews)

"Zen-Fi is a comprehensive personal finance management application I built using React, TypeScript, and Firebase. It features over 15 integrated modules including expense tracking, investment portfolio management, subscription tracking, and debt management. 

What makes it unique is the combination of real-time data synchronization, AI-powered financial insights using Google Gemini, and a gamification system that encourages users to maintain financial discipline through XP, achievements, and daily streaks.

The application uses modern technologies like TailwindCSS for styling, Recharts for interactive data visualizations, and Firebase for authentication and real-time database. I implemented advanced features like 6-month cash flow forecasting, debt payoff strategy comparisons, and PDF report generation.

The entire codebase is written in TypeScript for type safety, with over 70 reusable components and a scalable architecture using React Context API and TanStack Query for state management. It's fully responsive, supports dark mode, and follows accessibility best practices."
